Data arose from 12 secondary and tertiary public hospitals in two Danish regions, comprising approximately half the Danish population. Notes were operationalised with a fastText embedding, based on which we trained 10 270 neural-network models (one for each distinct single-drug/drug-pair exposure) predicting the risk of exposure given an embedding vector. We included 2 905 251 admissions between May 2008 and June 2016, with 13 740 564 distinct drug prescriptions; the median number of prescriptions was 5 (IQR: 3–9) and in 1 184 340 (41%) admissions patients used ≥5 drugs concomitantly. A total of 10 788 259 clinical notes were included, with 179 441 739 tokens retained after pruning. Of 345 single-drug signals reviewed, 28 (8.1%) represented possibly undescribed relationships; 186 (54%) signals were clinically meaningful. Sixteen (14%) of the 115 drug-pair signals were possible interactions, and two (1.7%) were known. In conclusion, we built a language-agnostic pipeline for mining associations between free-text information and medication exposure without manual curation, predicting not the likely outcome of a range of exposures but also the likely exposures for outcomes of interest. Our approach may help overcome limitations of text mining methods relying on curated data in English and can help leverage non-English free text for pharmacovigilance.

We trained artificial neural network and linear logistic ridge regression models to predict the risk of five outcomes (0, ≥1, ≥2, ≥3 and ≥5 inappropriate doses daily) with index set 24 hours after admission. We used time-series validation for evaluating discrimination, calibration, clinical utility and explanations. **Results**: Of 52,451 admissions included, 42,250 (81%) were used for model development. The median age was 77 years; 50% of admissions were of women. ≥5 drugs were used between admission start and index in 23,124 admissions (44%); the most common drug classes were analgesics, systemic antibacterials, diuretics, antithrombotics, and antacids. The neural network models had better discriminative power (all AUROCs between 0.77 and 0.81) and were better calibrated than their linear counterparts. The main prediction drivers were use of anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and anti-Parkison's drugs as well as having a diagnosis of chronic kidney failure. Sex and age affected predictions but slightly. **Conclusion**: Our models can flag patients at high risk of receiving at least one inappropriate dose daily in a controlled in-silico setting. A prospective clinical study may confirm this holds in real-life settings and translates into benefits in hard endpoints.

Our goal was to quantify the prevalence of potential drug–drug interactions in drug prescriptions at Danish hospitals, estimate the risk of adverse outcomes associated with discouraged drug combinations, and highlight the patient types (defined by the primary diagnosis of the admission) that appear to be more affected.\n**Methods** This cross-sectional (descriptive part) and cohort study (adverse outcomes part) used hospital electronic health records from two Danish regions (~2.5 million people) from January 2008 through June 2016. We included all inpatients receiving two or more medications during their admission and considered concomitant prescriptions of potentially interacting drugs as per the Danish Drug Interaction Database. We measured the prevalence of potential drug–drug interactions in general and discouraged drug pairs in particular during admissions and associations with adverse outcomes: post-discharge all-cause mortality rate, readmission rate and length-of-stay.\n**Results** Among 2,886,227 hospital admissions (945,475 patients; median age 62-years [IQR: 41–74]; 54% female; median number of drugs 7 [IQR: 4–11]), patients in 1 836 170 admissions were exposed to at least one potential drug–drug interaction (659 525 patients; median age 65 years [IQR: 49–77]; 54% female; median number of drugs 9 [IQR: 6–13]) and in 27 605 admissions to a discouraged drug pair (18 192 patients; median age 68 years [IQR: 58–77]; female 46%; median number of drugs 16 [IQR: 11–22]). Meropenem-valproic acid (HR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1–1.9), domperidone-fluconazole (HR: 2.5, 95% CI: 2.1–3.1), imipramine-terbinafine (HR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.2–12), agomelatine-ciprofloxacin (HR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.3–5.5), clarithromycin-quetiapine (HR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1–2.7) and piroxicam-warfarin (HR: 3.4, 95% CI: 1–11.4) were associated with elevated mortality. Confidence interval bounds of pairs associated with readmission were close to 1; length-of-stay results were inconclusive.\n**Conclusions** Well-described potential drug–drug interactions are still missed and alerts at point of prescription may reduce the risk of harming patients; prescribing clinicians should be alert when using strong inhibitor/inducer drugs (i.e. clarithromycin, valproic acid, terbinafine) and prevalent anticoagulants (i.e. warfarin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs - NSAIDs) due to their great potential for dangerous interactions. The most prominent CYP isoenzyme involved in mortality and readmission rates was 3A4.
